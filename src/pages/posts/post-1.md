<h2 id="AES">Aesthetics of Politics</h2>
            <h3>Editorial, 2023.</h3>
<p>The Anti-design movement emerged as a criticism of
                consumer culture and the comment on the excesses
                of Italian design and the continuous drive for
                novelty. The proponents of this new tendency were
                dissatisfified with the widespread diminution of the
                social relevance of design at the expense of capitalist
                enterprise. The group rejected the formalist values
                of the neo-modern design in Italy aiming to renew the cultural and political role of design.</p>
