            <h3>Editorial + Web + Visual Identity, 2023.</h3>
<p>Once upon a time, Jean-Luc Godard said "A story should have a beginning, a middle, and an end,
                    but not necessarily in that order". We follow this triad logic, assuming that a story can be
                    told through its various beginnings.</p>
                <p>Revealing itself as a retrospective of a very peculiar degree in communication design, this
                    project reflects not only the results that arise along a learning path, but also the experiences
                    and concerns that marked and continue to mark a generation. As a collective of 4 people, we
                    developed an exhibition and later the identity and communication of the project.</p>
