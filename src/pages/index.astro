            <h4>Editorial, 2023.</h4>
            <p>The Anti-design movement emerged as a criticism of
                consumer culture and the comment on the excesses
                of Italian design and the continuous drive for
                novelty. The proponents of this new tendency were
                dissatisfified with the widespread diminution of the
                social relevance of design at the expense of capitalist
                enterprise. The group rejected the formalist values
                of the neo-modern design in Italy aiming to renew the cultural and political role of design.</p>

                <h4>Identity + Communication + Editorial + Web, 2023.</h4>
                <p>Once upon a time, Jean-Luc Godard said "A story should have a beginning, a middle, and an end,
                    but not necessarily in that order". We follow this triad logic, assuming that a story can be
                    told through its various beginnings.</p>
                <p>Revealing itself as a retrospective of a very peculiar degree in communication design, this
                    project reflects not only the results that arise along a learning path, but also the experiences
                    and concerns that marked and continue to mark a generation. As a collective of 4 people, we
                    developed an exhibition and later the identity and communication of the project.</p>

                <h4>Editorial + Web, 2021.</h4>
                <p>ATENA is a personal project about a fictional feminist activist group names ATENA. In a team of
                    4, we developed a booklet containing texts and artciles about different topics on feminism,
                    together with a website with the same information and with the groupâ€™s objectives and beliefs.
